# URY Radiotext

It's the text that appears on the screens of radios like in your car when you tune to us on FM.

## Features

- Default Message
- Current Show
- Now Playing Song
- Next Show
- URY News on the hour

## Running

Set the `config.yml` file, with SSH login to the transmmitter raspberry pi. This can be run with Docker, by binding your config file to `/usr/src/app/config.yml` (in production we store this in `/opt/radiotext`).
